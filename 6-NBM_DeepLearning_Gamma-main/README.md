# Prerequisites

<details><summary> Summary of prerequisite skills required to succeed in this course (click to expand) </summary>

* Students should be proficient in general python, pandas, and basic visualization libraries -- able to comfortably use these tools in order to explore, analyze, and visualize tabular datasets.
* Students should be comfortable with the mathematics fundamentals of machine learning including calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
* Students should have theoretical knowledge of and practical experience in major supervised machine learning topics including regression models, classification models, and model evaluation.
* Comfort with web scraping or obtaining data through application programming interfaces (APIs) is a definite plus for expanding the range of possible projects a student can complete, but is not strictly necessary to succeed in the course.

# Learning Objectives

<details><summary> Actionable, assessed learning goals for this course, broken out by category (click to expand) </summary>
  
**Neural Networks - Introductory**

1.  Correctly convert non-tabular data sources into numerical arrays that can be analyzed and processed as neural network inputs.
2.  Precisely describe the architecture, prediction process, and training methodology of feed-forward neural networks.
3.  Successfully construct neural networks in python, tuning their hyperparameters with rigorous model training and evaluation techniques. 

**Neural Networks - Advanced**

1.  Precisely describe the architecture and prediction process of convolutional neural networks, successfully building them to handle image data inputs in python.
2.  Precisely describe the architecture and prediction process of recurrent neural networks, successfully building them to handle sequential data inputs in python.
3.  Successfully apply transfer learning to improve the quality of both image and text processing neural networks. 

</details>

# Completion Requirements

In order to successfully complete the course, students are required to:

* Complete a project with a score of 15 or above (refer to the [project introduction](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_intro.md) and [project success guide](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_success_guide.md))

* <details><summary> Receive an average score of at least 60% across the assessments (click to expand) </summary>

   There will be assessments throughout the course (refer to the schedule above); students will be given access to an assessment to complete at that time. Each assessment will consist of 20 multiple choice questions (with four options per question), which students will have 60 minutes to complete. The assessments are open-book.
   
   The assessment will have questions related to the learning objectives detailed above. The objectives give a roadmap of which areas should be focused on in preparation.

</details>

### Repo Issues

At Metis, we aim to keep our course content as error-free and seamlessly functional as possible, frequently reviewing and refining it. While we expect that you will find few issues when navigating and using our course repos (either on GitHub or locally), we know we're not perfect. If you encounter issues, it can help you, your peers, future students, and us if you let us know about them by using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde-RqyXVR-UXvMbhZSp068__rw--36hrLGPsqtp-XJUDWh5g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
