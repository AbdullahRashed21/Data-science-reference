Work with your partner to answer the following review questions. 
Some questions may have multiple correct answers, and may be difficult! Do your best to answer what you can without
looking up course notes or researching online except as noted, but then feel free to use the resources available to you to look things up.
Don't worry if you can't get to all of the questions, there are a lot.

**1.** Define the following technical terms used to describe neural networks:
  * Linear combination 
  * Weights 
  * Bias 
  * Activation function
  * Neuron/unit
  * Hidden layers
  * Fully connected

**2.** What’s the purpose of activation functions? List as many examples as you can and define the functions (aim for 3 most important activations and more if you can!). 

**3.** Describe how the parameters of a neural network model are trained.

**4.** *To answer this question, do some research*. What regularization methods are available to neural networks? Describe how they work.

**5.** Describe how convolutions operate on image inputs. 

**6.** What is transfer learning? Start with a high level explanation and move to a concrete example of how it might be implemented. 

**Bonus Questions** (may require additional research beyond what’s been discussed in class)

**7.** Walk through all of the steps of a standard convolutional neural network model, e.g. the VGG16 architecture or a similar model

**8.** What does max pooling accomplish in CNNs?

**9.** Describe how an RNN (and/or LSTM) processes sequential data
