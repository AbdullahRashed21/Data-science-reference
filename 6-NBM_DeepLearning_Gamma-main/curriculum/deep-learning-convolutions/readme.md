# Sample Lesson Plan

- [Convolutional Neural Nets](convolutional_neural_networks.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students can:

- Understand the core components of CNNs (including convolutional filters and
  max pooling) and how they can be used to construct a network architecture
  appropriate for image processing
- Use keras to construct and train a simple CNN from scratch
- Apply the standard transfer learning framework to adapt a pretrained base CNN
  to a specialized image task

- (Optional) Apply key practical techniques in image processing such as batch
  generation from disk, image augmentation, and one-time extraction of
  convolutional base features

# Additional Resources

[Francois Chollet's notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks),
which accompany his deep learning textbook, are an excellent resource for
practical learning on CNNs and neural networks more broadly.
