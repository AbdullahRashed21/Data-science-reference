# Sample Lesson Plan

**[Transfer_Learning.pptx](./Transfer_Learning.pptx)**: Overview on transfer learning and how it's
typically applied to NLP with pre-trained word embeddings.

**[NeuralNet_Features_TransferLearning.ipynb](./NeuralNet_Features_TransferLearning.ipynb)**: This notebook contains
a lot of extra content building conceptual intuition for neural networks as
feature learners as well as giving keras examples, but for this lecture the
focus can be on the sections toward the end -- an applied example of transfer
learning with RNNs for a text classification task.

# Learning Objectives

Students can

- Understand the transfer learning framework and how it can concretely be
  applied to machine learning problems in NLP.
