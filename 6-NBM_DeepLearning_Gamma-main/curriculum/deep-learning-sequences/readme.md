# Sample Lesson Plan

- Can return to [transfer learning notebook](../transfer-learning/NeuralNet_Features_TransferLearning.ipynb)
for an introduction to RNN components and a strong starting example for text RNNs with transfer learning
- More text examples: [Deep Learning for NLP](./2-deep-learning-for-nlp.ipynb)
- Time series examples: see additional resources
