# Sample Lesson Plan
- [Ensembling Slides](ensembling.pdf) 
- Coding example:
	- [Ensemble Prep](Ensemble_Prep.ipynb) to train and save a few models as pickle files
	- [Ensemble Methods](Ensemble_Methods.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students can:
* Relate ensembling to tree-based methods like bagging.
* Understand and explain key concepts of ensembling models.
    * Voting Classifiers
    * Stacking
    * How ensembling affects over/underfitting  
* Use meta-estimators to apply ensembling to other models.
