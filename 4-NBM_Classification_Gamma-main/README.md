# Prerequisites

<details><summary> Summary of prerequisite skills required to succeed in this course (click to expand) </summary>
 
* Students should be proficient in general python, pandas, and basic visualization libraries -- able to comfortably use these tools in order to explore, analyze, and visualize tabular datasets 
* Students should be comfortable with the mathematics fundamentals of machine learning including calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics
* Students should be familiar with the theory and applications of linear regression 
* Students should understand foundational concepts in machine learning, including supervised learning terminology, 
regularization, bias/variance trade-off, gradient descent, and model selection and evaluation techniques such as cross validation
 
</details>

# Learning Objectives

<details><summary> Actionable, assessed learning goals for this course, broken out by category (click to expand) </summary>
  
**Classification Algorithms**

1. Explain the theoretical underpinnings of common classification algorithms, including their assumptions and limitations
2. Evaluate the relative merits of each classification algorithm in terms of predictive performance, interpretability, and complexity

**Classification Evaluation and Application**

1. Calculate key metrics used evaluate classification models
2. Identify appropriate use cases for each classification metric
3. Apply ensembling, hyperparameter tuning, and class imbalance strategies to improve classification performance
4. Effectively apply classification concepts to real-world business problems


</details>

# Completion Requirements

In order to successfully complete the course, students are required to:

* Complete a project with a score of 15 or above (refer to the [project introduction](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_intro.md) 
and [project success guide](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_success_guide.md))

* <details><summary> Receive an average score of at least 60% across the assessments (click to expand) </summary>

   There will be assessments throughout the course (refer to the schedule above); students will be given access to an assessment to complete at that time. Each assessment will consist of 20 multiple choice questions (with four options per question), which students will have 60 minutes to complete. The assessments are open-book.
   
   The assessment will have questions related to the learning objectives detailed above. The objectives give a roadmap of which areas should be focused on in preparation.

### Repo Issues

At Metis, we aim to keep our course content as error-free and seamlessly functional as possible, frequently reviewing and refining it. While we expect that you will find few issues when navigating and using our course repos (either on GitHub or locally), we know we're not perfect. If you encounter issues, it can help you, your peers, future students, and us if you let us know about them by using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde-RqyXVR-UXvMbhZSp068__rw--36hrLGPsqtp-XJUDWh5g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
